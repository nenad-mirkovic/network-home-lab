# Cisco 2950G Switch Configurations

### This section contains the configuration commands and sample labs for the Cisco 2950 switch

### Create a VLAN
  ```
  vlan 10
  name HR
  exit
  ```
  vlan - command creates a vlan \
  name - used to give description of the vlan \
  exit - exit vlan configuration
  

 ### Vlan can be created in interface configuration mode
  ```
  interface f0/1
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 10
  exit
  ```
  * To assign a name to the VLAN, you must enter VLAN configuration mode using `vlan 10` and then use `name IT`. This is a best practice for creating and managing VLANs.

### To see the vlans on a switch use
  ` show vlan brief` - in Privileged EXEC mode (en) or \
  ` do show vlan brief` - in a global configuration mode (conf t)
